1. Initial World View
When the user first opens the map, show a world map.

At this level, display only the full English names of countries and a few global cities as appropriate.

No abbreviations for country names—always use the full country name (e.g., “Brazil” instead of “BR”).

2. Zoom Behavior and Label Density
As the user zooms in, dynamically display more geographic data:

Show as many cities as possible (from the database) at each zoom level, with the number increasing as you zoom in.

Make sure labels never overlap—if two city labels would collide, use a smart algorithm to filter/hide the less important one, but maximize how many can be shown clearly.

Font size and display density must adapt smoothly to the zoom level and available space.

Cities of all sizes (not just capitals or major hubs) should be shown, as long as their labels do not overlap.

3. Label Display Rules
At every zoom level:

No label overlaps: Country and city names must never collide or cover each other.

No codes or abbreviations for country names—only display full names.

If the map is too crowded, use collision detection to automatically hide some city labels, but always attempt to show as many as possible.

4. Visited Location Highlighting
Countries and cities the user has visited should be highlighted in green (border or fill).

Unvisited places use default map colors.

No special icons or markers—just clear color difference for visited places.

5. Data Display Principle
The goal is to show all cities for which data exists, not just major cities or capitals.

The display should adapt to the zoom level: low zoom = fewer labels, high zoom = more labels.

At the highest zoom, try to show all cities and place names in the database, as long as it remains readable.

6. Aesthetic and UX Goals
The map must always look clean, organized, and professional, with no overcrowding.

Label fonts, colors, and density should adapt to provide the best readability at every zoom.

The style should match Google Maps or Apple Maps: dynamic, user-friendly, and easy to navigate.

7. Problems to Avoid
Do not allow label overlap at any time.

Do not use country abbreviations (e.g., “BR”, “AT”, etc.).

Do not omit cities that can be shown clearly—maximize visible data without losing readability.

Do not show all city names at once if it creates clutter—use smart filtering and dynamic adjustment.

8. Technical Suggestions (Optional)
Use libraries such as Mapbox GL JS, Google Maps API, or Leaflet.js with a label collision plugin.

Leverage dynamic layer management, label collision detection, and font scaling.

Use GeoJSON or similar formats for city/country data; apply conditional styling for visited places.

Summary:
The map must dynamically display as many cities as possible from the database, maximizing label visibility while keeping the map clean and readable at all times. Never use country abbreviations—only full names. All visited places should be highlighted in green. At no time should labels overlap or become unreadable. The experience should match the clarity and dynamic style of Google Maps, but with the unique requirement to show all available cities as much as possible.
